## Compiling

A Makefile is supported, which automatically identifies all `.cpp` and `.c` files
inside `/dev/src`. All you need to do in order to compile this masterpiece of 
gaming is run:

```bash
$ cd dev
$ make
``` 

You can also clean the generated binaries by running:

```bash
$ cd dev
$ make clean
```
